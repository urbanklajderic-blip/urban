Returns busy intervals enriched with event details and calculates free slots by finding gaps between busy periods; `time_min` must precede `time_max` if both are provided. This action retrieves free and busy time slots for the specified calendars over a given time period. It analyzes the busy intervals from the calendars and provides calculated free slots based on the gaps in the busy periods.",
